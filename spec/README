README

The 2020 challenge....should you accept...

We are a ruby community, so lets try a simple ruby exercise together.

Let's generate all the dates of the meetup for the year.

So, please write a line of code that moves the solution forward. And then tag someone else in the community. 

I've tried to set this up on an online editor, so no-one has to install anything :)

Here is your specification:
===========================

* The meetup is on the 3rd Thursday of the month. 

* It should output 12 dates, one per month.

* The first date should be Thursday 16th January.

* There should be a ruby class called Generate. 
* It should have a method called 'dates' which can be used to start the exercise and generate the output.

* The end solution should have tests. Possibly in rspec. 
It doesn't necessarily have to be you who writes a test ;)

* The project deadline is Thursday 16th January. 
We can meetup and discuss the solutions & collaborate on the results.

We have the whatsapp group to post questions to.
Happy collaborating :)
